Version 1.3:
 * Expansion and improvements to the plot and dialogue, adding new cutscenes that give you a closer look at the antagonists' motives.
 * Several new levels were added to the dungeon environment; with some of them being optional, there's much more to explore now.
 * Some new enemies to be vanquished: a red bat that's much more tenacious than the regular ones, and the hard-hitting ninja-kitty, that has many tools at his disposal to fight you. And these are just a few examples!
 * New difficulty level: Challenging. Some enemies will be faster, hardier, smarter, or all of those put together.
 * A better "New Game/Load Game" screen, that allows the selection of save slots.
 * New power-up system, based on a common "mana" resource - now players can choose what powers to use at any time, if they've acquired them and have enough mana to use them.
 * Two new power-ups: Fire-breath attack and an energy shot that homes in on enemies.
 * Graphical improvements abound: ground tiles on most environments were reworked, adding better perspective, and being improved on in general.
 * Lots of new objects show up in the foreground and background, giving more depth and diversity to each map.
 * Many new tracks were added to the soundtrack, while most of the previous repertoire has been enhanced.
 * A much wider and smarter usage of sound effects; now you'll be able to notice flying enemies' wings flapping, kitties running around, and even the sounds Frogatto make are when moving around are dependent on terrain.

Version 1.2:
 * Complete redo of attack logic; frogatto now is free to walk around whilst he attacks, and in general is much more responsive.
 * Frogatto's tongue-grabbing is MUCH more forgiving
 * Complete rewrite of damage handling; much more consistent now, and categorically eliminates some bugs where damage wouldn't get dealt.
 * Reworked some tilesets to eliminate tiling errors.
 * Further enhancements to dungeon wall graphics (added edges).
 * New, more readable dialogue font.
 * Lots of small graphical tweaks.
 * Maps are now strewn with spittable props within easy reach.
 * Rewrote most of the dialogue.
 * Collectible items like coins can be collected by being touched by the tongue, besides just frogatto's body.
 * Redrew the world map.
 * Added a few new monsters, like the red hornbugs, and completely rewrote how bats behave.
 * Fixed a bug that caused a black line in the seaside background during dialogues.
 * Fixed a bug that caused some tiles to incorrectly be flagged as opaque.

Version 1.1.1:
 * Fixed some crashing bugs.
 * Fixed The Long Haul (arcade level)
 * Fixed instructions on titlescreen
