# This prototype is for doors which have no 'physical door' in them that has to be opened - rather, just open portals you just walk through freely, like the mouth of a cave.
# It's meant for doors you collide with by running into them, rather than pressing an interact button, so it's likely unsuitable for anything but doors on the horizontal sides of a level.

# These doors need to have a "door_area" set in them to work.
