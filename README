Frogatto & Friends is an action-adventure game, starring a certain quixotic frog.  We're trying to push 2D platforming, pixel-art, and music into uncharted territory; we hope you like the results!

Frogatto is driven by a very flexible, high-performance 2d game engine we've developed, called "Anura" - it's suitable for almost any 2D videogame, and has a few special features for pixel-art and graphical-effects commonly seen in pixel-art titles.  It has already been used to ship another complete game, called Cube Trains, and several others are in the works.

The game's source code license can be found in the LICENSE file in the distribution.

See INSTALL for instructions on building from source, or check the Downloads page [http://www.frogatto.com/download] in our website for ready to use packages for your platform.

This repository houses the Frogatto module for the Anura engine, but versions 1.3.1 of Frogatto and prior contain the engine as well and are incompatible with the Anura repository.
